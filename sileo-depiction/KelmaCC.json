Recreates the look of SimpleWordsCC for Polus back in the iOS 9 JB days.\r\n\r\nThe only CC toggles themed are the ones you can see in the screenshots, and the ones that have a settings icon. It‚Äôs a mix of Apple stock CC toggles and CCModules. Animated toggles such as Lock Orientation, DND, Screen Recorder and LPM cannot be themed. Please do not ask me about them. You need to use corresponding toggles from FlipConvert.\r\n\r\nThis covers 93 toggles.\r\n\r\nThis was tested ONLY on iPhone XS (12.1.1). I only made @3x icons (7/8 Plux, and X/XS/XS Max). I can‚Äôt test other devices so hopefully this looks good on them. Most toggles are automatically resized, but for some tweaks you need to resize and create your own 2x image.<h2>IMPORTANT! READ THIS!</h2><ul><li>The WiFi and Bluetooth icons are themed using BetterCCIconsPro. I've included both files inside the theme folder (/Library/Themes/KelmaCC.theme/Bundles/BetterCCIconsPro), so you guys need to move them (just the images, not the entire folder) to <b>/Library/PreferenceBundles/BetterCCIcons.bundle</b> and then enable Glyph mode in the settings. I do not know any other way to theme those two icons, so please don‚Äôt ask me about it.</li><li>So that animated toggles, such as DND, Lock Orientation and so on are themed, you need the toggles from FlipConvert. I suggest the one from <a class=\"text-primary\" href=\"https://kingpuffdaddi.github.io\">https://kingpuffdaddi.github.io</a></li><li>As of 2019-10-24, if you‚Äôre on <b>iOS 11</b>, you can use either <b>Anemone 2.1.7 or 2.1.8, or iThemer</b>. If you‚Äôre on <b>iOS 12</b>, you can only use <b>iThemer, or Snowboard UI Extention Beta</b>.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nAs a last note, although this is free, donations are <i>very</i> welcome. I've spent a lot of effort and invested time into this for everyone. I hope it's to your liking!",
